**Project Overview**
This project is a classic Java-based backend CRUD application, encompassing fundamental knowledge required for web backend development. 
The primary functionality involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations for students and teachers within a school environment.

**Version Highlights**
**V1 & V2**
Core Features: Implemented the basic functionalities of the project using Spring Boot and MyBatis to handle CRUD operations for students and teachers.
Three-Layer Architecture: Adopted a layered architecture consisting of Controller, Service, and DAO layers:
Controller: Manages interactions with the frontend.
Service: Handles business logic and data processing.
DAO: Responsible for database operations.
This structure closely mirrors the architecture commonly used in enterprise web development.
**V3**
New Features:
Introduced one of the three main web components, Filter, and utilized Interceptors from the Spring Boot framework to handle login authentication.
Implemented JWT tokens, cookies, and sessions for secure user authentication.
Decoupling with IoC & DI: To achieve better separation of concerns, Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) were utilized.
Additional Enhancements: Added transaction management and global exception handling for improved stability and error management.
**V4**
AOP for Logging: Added logging functionality using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to track user operations and system events.
**V5**
Project Management with Maven: Standardized the project structure and dependencies using Maven for easier management and integration.
**Key Learnings**
Database Design & Operations: Developed skills in designing and managing database tables.
Frontend-Backend Separation: Gained experience in mainstream development patterns, including API testing and integration based on development documentation.
Web Development Solutions: Mastered common web development solutions, such as file storage and login authentication strategies.
Core Web Knowledge: Acquired the ability to develop features based on prototypes, requirements, and API documentation.
